# TaskBurner
A Todo list that helps you plan your day and make sure you get your task done by seperating everything into four lists.

# The four lists

## Back Burner
This todo list is for any task that you are currently not focusing on at the moment.

## Front Burner
This todo list is restricted to three tasks at a time and these tasks are your main source of attention

## Vitamins
This todo list is meant to store any daily task that must be done everyday.

## Oven
This todo list are for tasks that need to be done eventually but are rarely frequent. (Ex: Pay rent this month)
